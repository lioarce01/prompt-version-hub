## What it does
- Centralizes your prompts with automatic versioning, Git-style diffs, and one-click rollback.
- Includes an AI Prompt Generator to bootstrap structured templates fast.
- Deploys across environments (dev/staging/prod) with a clear release history.
- Scopes prompts and deployments per user with public/private visibility controls and cloning.
- Runs deterministic A/B testing by segments and tracks performance per version.
- Traces usage and outcomes (success, latency, cost) to optimize quality and spending.
- Provides access control with JWT and role-based permissions (admin/editor/viewer), plus ready-to-use SDKs (Python/JS).
